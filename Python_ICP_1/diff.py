print("""Difference between Python 2 and Python 3
Print: In Python 2, “print” is treated as a statement but in Python 3 it treats “print” as a
function
Integer Division:Python 2 treats numbers without any digits after the decimal point as integers,
which will lead to unexpected results during division.
Raising Exceptions: python 3 - raise IOError(“”)
Python 2 - raise IOError, “ error message""")
